The application must manage a set of rooms. A room can be a single room or a double room.
For double rooms, it must be possible to add extra beds (1 or 2 depending on room size).

You must be able to register a customer and edit their details. 
A customer may be deleted only if there are no bookings linked to them 
— the app must check for existing bookings before deletion.

A room can be booked for a customer for one or more nights. 
The app must manage bookings and show which rooms are available for a given period. 
It must prevent double-booking (no booking allowed for dates already booked for that room).

It must be possible to cancel a booking or modify a booking. 
You must be able to search by date or date-range 
and number of persons and get all available rooms that match the search.

Every booking must have an associated payment (i.e., an invoice). 
The app must be able to register an incoming payment on an invoice. 
If no payment is registered within 10 days after the booking is created, 
the booking is cancelled (it becomes void).
